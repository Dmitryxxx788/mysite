                Spider-Man first appeared in Marvel Comics’ Amazing Fantasy in 1962. The following year, he was given his own comic-book series, The Amazing Spider-Man. This was soon Marvel's top-selling title, and the character became a cultural icon.
                In 1972, Spider-Man’s popularity was used to raise the profile of other superheroes and villains with the Marvel Team Up series of comics, in which the young web-slinger was paired with a different character every issue.
                Description
Variations
Over the years, Spider-Man has appeared in various sets, and several different versions of his minifigure have been produced. The ones in the old theme all reflect his appearance in the movie continuity. The Super Heroes variation appears as his Ultimate Spider-Man TV show version and as him in the black suit.

Studios Costume
Spider-Man's first appearance in his classic suit, this variation appeared only in the Studios sets 1376 Spider-Man Action Studio, and 10075 Spider-Man Action Pack. It is nearly identical the the later Spider-Man 1 Costume, except for the addition of a red neck bracket on his back, presumably to attach web to.

Wrestling Costume
This variation was originally intended to appear in two sets, 1375 Wrestling Scene and 4850 Spider-Man's First Chase, however, 1375 was never released. The variation is taken from the sequence in the movie Spider-Man where Peter Parker fights in a wrestling match as "Spider-Man" to raise some money. In this variant he wears a long-sleeved shirt with a complicated spider design printed on it, and blue pants. This costume, unlike any of his other variants, shows Peter Parker's eyes and eyebrows, which are a light brown.

Spider-Man 1 Costume
The variant of Spider-Man used in the Spider-Man 1 sub-theme: blue pants with red hips with webbing printed on them, a red and blue torso with a web design printed on it in silver, and a spider in black, blue arms, and red hands. His head is red, with silver webbing and eyes printed on it.

Spider-Man 2 Costume
For Spider-Man 2, Spidey's costume was updated once again. Now his legs, arms, and a small section on his torso were dark blue, although, like previous versions, he still has a red torso, head, and hips. His spider symbols on the front and back are also different.

As a 4 Plus Figure
When Spider-Man (4 Plus) was released in 2004, it required a special 4+ Figure Spider-Man. In this incarnations, Spider-Man was exactly the same as his Spider-Man 2 version, except for the facts that his hips were dark blue, that he was all one piece, and has differently molded limbs.

Ultimate Spider-Man
SpiderMan 01
Spider-Man in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes

Spider-Man is the same design as his previous variants, but has been altered in order to represent a more cartoony version. He has a red head without any head accessories to represent his mask, and it is printed with a web design and large, white eyes. His torso is blue instead of red with red printed on. The web design is black rather than silver, his black spider logo is smaller, and printing to show the suit's cut against his body is added. Like previous verions he has back printing on his head and back.His head has the same design but in black. His back printing is mostly blue with a large red spider and the top and bottom is red with black webbing, also printing is added to show the cut of the suit on his back.He has blue hips, legs, and arms with red hands. Spider-Man comes with a white rope to represent webbing.

Black Suit
This SDCC-exclusive version of Spider-Man is completely black and is based off its Ultimate Spider-Man TV series appearance. The minifigure only has two areas of printing: the head and the torso. The head is decorated only with large, plain white eyes, and the torso details his spider logo, which covers most of the torso. The torso is also exactly the same as Venom's torso.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Suit
He has a red head printed with the same web design as the Ultimate Spider-Man but slightly smaller white eyes, with a hexagonal pattern in the eyes. The torso is red and printed with a larger web design, a larger spider whose bottom legs extend to the end of the torso, the dark blue triangles on either side with a sequence design, and the suits cut on his body. He has dark blue arms and red hands. He has dark blue hips and red legs that are printed with blue short with the sequences type design that forms red boots.

Juniors
This version is identical to the Ultimate Spider-Man, but it uses a red hip piece.

Mighty Micros
In the style of the theme, this Spider-Man has short legs and a simplified, yet exaggerated design. His head is very similar to his Ultimate Spider-Man variant, but his right eye is narrowed in concentration. His torso has a more basic version of the previous variant.

Video Game
His appearance is identical to the Super Heroes sets he appears in. His black symbiote suit is playable in a DLC.

A Future Foundation and Superior Suit are included in the game.

His abilities include Spider-Sense, which allows him to detect hidden object, shoot webbing, swing on webbing, and pull on objects with webbing. He can also climb on special walls.
